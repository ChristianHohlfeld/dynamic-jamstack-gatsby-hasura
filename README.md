# Dynamic JAMStack with Gatsby and Hasura GraphQL

This repo has demo apps to showcase how dynamic content can be added to Gatsby using Hasura GraphQL.

`static-site` - This is a pure static site with even content hardcoded on the HTML.

`dynamic-source-build` - This is a static site with content sourced from a database (Postgres) and built using GraphQL APIs.

`dynamic-auth-client` - This app has pages which are protected by auth. Client side interactions are authenticated.
